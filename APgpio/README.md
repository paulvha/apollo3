# GPIO input /output settings
## ===========================================================

## Background

The Apollo3 chip has different GPIO setting to adjust the input and output pad. However due to the “Arduino-like” compatibility, not all of these options can be addressed with the default / standard code. This code is working directly with the HAL (Hardware Abstraction Layer) to perform different settings. The code has been tested on both the V1.2.1 and V2.0.6 boards library from Sparkfun.

## Disclaimer

During testing the code I accidentally damaged one of the pad (41) on my ATP board. Oh well..XXX happens. BUT I want to warn you to be careful and be fully aware that using any open source code, like this one, **you are on your own: No Support, No warranty, NO help with damage**. In legal terms :

## Pin or Pad

A “pin” is the name of the place where you connect your wire on a board. A pad is the connection point of the Apollo3 processor to the board. While “pin” does not have to be the same as a “pad” on a number of Apollo3 board it is. That said you should check the schematics to be sure. Often there is confusion whether to use a pinName (like D3) or a pin / pad-number (like 3). When addressing the HAL it is always the pad-number, the layer(s) above will translate a pinName to a pad-number.

<br> To help, I have created an overview of the different Artemis boards. I have mapped the pin-descriptions printed on board to the different pads. If a pad is used on the board internally that is called out also. It is the spreadsheets AP_pads in the extras-folder of the library.

## Commands available

There are 3 commands available:
```
### APmode(pad,mode)
This will set a pad in an certain mode
Pad    : a number between 0 and 50
Mode   :
	M_VDD 		enable power Switch to 3v3 on other pad 3 or 36
	M_VSS,		enable power Switch to 3v3 on other pad 41 or 37
	M_INPUT,	set pad as input
	M_OUTPUT,   set pad as output (*note 1)
	M_PULLUP,   set pad as input with pullup resistor (*note 2)
	M_PULLDOWN  set pad with pulldown (only pad 20 is allowed)

Return : TRUE if succeeded, False if failed

*note1 : An additional argument can be passed to set strength as 2mA, 4mA, 8mA or 12mA*
*note2 : An additional argument can be passed to set pullup resistor 1.5K, 6K, 12K, 24K*

### APset(pad, level)
This will set a level on an output pad (set previously with APmode())
Pad    : a number between 0 and 50
mode   : HIGH or LOW
Return : TRUE if succeeded, False if failed.

### APread(pad)
This will read the input level from a pad.
Pad    : a number between 0 and 50
return : True = HIGH, False = LOW
```
## Software installation
Copy the APgpio-directory in the Sparkfun boards library folder:
xxx/libraries. xxx is 1.2.1 or 2.0.6 (depending on the version).
In this libraries folder you also find others like SPI or Wire.

## Prerequisites
Example4 is depending on ![BME280](https://github.com/sparkfun/SparkFun_BME280_Arduino_Library)

## Examples
4 examples are available:
* Example1 : set three different inputs
* Example2 : set output
* Example3 : Set power switch output
* Example4 : Set Power switch output for BME280

## Versioning
### Version 1.0 / May 2021
* initial version
