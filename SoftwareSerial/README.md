# Software Serial on V2.1.1

## ===========================================================
April 2021 / paulvha

## Background

Many people raised question: where is softwareSerial on V2 of the Apollo3 library?
Sounds like a nice challenge to try. I started off with the version that was written by Nathan Seidle for V1.2.x Apollo3 library. This V1 library is NOT using MBED-OS, but has all the functions in itself.

## Result

After long testing and debugging Software Serial it is possible with sending at 38400 (with some luck) / receiving speed up to 19200.

Higher speeds are not possible with V2.0.x library as MBED is impacting the overall performance of the excution process with factor of about 2. So execution of a user level program on V2 is slower as it seems that the processor is being busy with something else.

That said, normally you would not notice the difference due to the large processor-idle time a normal program has, however when dealing with microseconds precision it becomes an issue as expained below.

However for many solutions a 19200 baud sending/receiving Software Serial is a good enough solution.

## Boards supported

SoftwareSerial has been tested on many Artemis boards. But not all boards are 100% the same. Please read the explained.odt and example8 to fine tune the transmission baud rate. This is especially important if you plan to use it on EDGE or EDGE2 as the default compensation needs to be adjusted for this boards.

## More detailed information

See the document explained.odt, which you can read with any word processor.
For usage see https://www.arduino.cc/en/Reference/SoftwareSerial

In case you plan to use this in a solution where the Artemis processor is put to sleep, handle SofwareSerial the same as Serial. So call mySerial.end() before going to sleep and mySerial.begin() after waking up.

## Installation

1. Copy the complete SofwareSerial-directory in the directory :   apollo3/2.2.1/libraries

## Versioning

### version 1.0.3 May 2023
 * added example8 and TX baudrate compensation routines
 * sending speed to 38400 is possible (with some luck)

### version 1.0.2 October 2021
 * updated version for V 2.1.1 to allow by-passing MBED interrupt handling. It is now handling 19200 stable and can often achieve 38400 baud receiving, but sending only up to 19200.

### version April 2021
 * Initial version SoftwareSerial for Library 2.0.6 achieving 9600 baud RX
