/**
 * SoftWire - Version 1.0 / paulvha / February 2019
 *
 * This is a bit-banging I2C implemenation that is taken from the ESP8266.
 * It has been adjusted to work on an ESP32 and support clock-stretching.
 *
 * The hardware I2C on an ESP32 is known for NOT supporting clock stretching.
 *
 * While it is aimed and tested for the SCD30, it should work for other
 * devices on the ESP32 as well.
 *
 * Below the original heading on the ESP8266

  Modified December 2014 by Ivan Grokhotkov (ivan@esp8266.com) - esp8266 support
  Modified April 2015 by Hrsto Gochkov (ficeto@ficeto.com) - alternative esp8266 support


* December 2024 / paulvha : Special port for MLX90614
* Tested on UNOR4 & Artemis ATP V 1.2.3
